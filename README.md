A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merc_(MUD)">MERC</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_killing#Player_killing">PK</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> named Um...Godwars.
<br>
MERC was created by Michael Chastain ("Furey"), Michael Quan ("Kahn"), and Mitchell Tse ("Hatchet").
<br>
An extention to MERC called Godwars was created by Kavir.
<br>
This particular version of Godwars has many new features created by myself and <a href="https://github.com/piptastic">Jason "Pip" Wallace</a>.
<br>
We ran the MUD for several years starting back sometime in 1998.
<br>
The original Godwars code and gameplay had some...vulgar themes.  I removed what I could to try and keep this code clean for release.
<br>
<br>
Notable additions:
<ul>
  <li>A 2d colorized ascii-map based on the surrounding room structure, also showed mobile locations</li>
  <li>Tournaments</li>
  <li>Kingdoms</li>
	<li>Highlander class</li>
  <li>Random line of code echo (random weirdness was a common theme of our MUD)</li>
	<li>Hackify and Colorize modes (changes all output in the game, EXP bonus, random fun)</li>
  <li>Trivia</li>
  <li>Random quest token drops (globally announced so players can hunt for them)</li>
  <li>Insult code (randomly makes 1 player insult another one)</li>
  <li>News board</li>
  <li>Complete randomization of areas and their difficulty each reboot</li>
  <li>Hotreboot</li>
  <li>...and many little things I'm sure I've forgotten...</li>
</ul>
